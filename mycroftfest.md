# MycroftFest call for contributions

<img src="images/am2022.jpg" style="float:right; max-height: 200px; margin: 15px;" />

We solicit contributions for a celebration in honour of the work of [Professor Alan Mycroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/) on the occasion of his retirement from the University of Cambridge.  Alan is well-known for his many pioneering contributions to programming language theory and applications, both design and implementation, ranging from compilation and optimization techniques and type systems, to parallel, concurrent and dataflow programming, but also for his work as a co-founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. To those who worked with Alan, he is renowned for his unstoppable enthusiasm about any challenging problem related to programming and computers, making him an inspiring teacher, mentor, and collaborator.

To celebrate Alan's retirement, there will be a hybrid event in the early winter (1st December) with talks given from those contributing submissions both of a technical and personal nature. Then in early 2024 we will publish a Festschrift to mark the occasion, with a submission deadline of 31st January.

We solicit original contributions in all areas of programming language research, including clever hacker tricks, beautiful mathematical theories, practically useful programming techniques, novel language design ideas, and visions for the future of education and programming technology. Just as Alan does not fit any pre-existing well-defined box, we invite contributions outside the established boxes that cover a wide range of areas and use a wide range of styles. The only criteria is academic interest and novelty and a connection to Alan's own work. Furthemore, we would also happily receive talk proposals of a more informal nature, for example, to talk about previous collaborations with Alan or early interactions.

We are extending this invite to all of Alan's previous students, colleagues, and collaborators and we would be happy for this to be shared widely.
