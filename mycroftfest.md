# MycroftFest call for papers

We solicit contributions for a festschrift in honour of the work of [Professor Alan Mycroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/) on the occasion of his retirement from the University of Cambridge.  Alan is well-known for his many pioneering contributions to programming language theory and applications, both design and implementation, ranging from compilation and optimization techniques and type systems, to parallel, concurrent and dataflow programming, but also for his work as a co-founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. To those who worked with Alan, he is renowned for his unstoppable enthusiasm about any challenging problem related to programming and computers, making him an inspiring teacher, mentor, and collaborator.

To celebrate Alan's retirement, we solicit original contributions in all areas of programming language research, including clever hacker tricks, beautiful mathematical theories, practically useful programming techniques, novel language design ideas, and visions for the future of education and programming technology. Just as Alan does not fit any pre-existing well-defined box, we invite contributions outside the established boxes that cover a wide range of areas and use a wide range of styles. The only criteria is academic interest and novelty and a connection to Alan's own work.

We are extending this invite to all of Alan's previous students, colleagues, and collaborators and we would be happy for this to be shared widely. We are however also trying to keep this a *secret* (for as long as possible) so please do keep this off any public lists for now!

There will be a hybrid event in the early winter (1st December) with talks given from those contributing submissions.  Depending on submission rates, we may accept proposals to give a talk even without a festschrift submission.

## Submission, evaluation, and participation

If you are interested in submitting and/or attending then we would
appreciate you filling out this short expression of interest form (by
August 1st) so we can keep track of everyone and send the occasional
update:

[Expressions of interest form](https://forms.gle/A2hZ6wn8NV1QQhmd7)

We intend to publish the festschrift (publishers to be confirmed). The submissions should follow the LNCS formatting guidelines and should be at least 6 pages, but not typically exceeding 25 pages. All submissions will be reviewed by at least two expert reviewers that will be appointed by the special issue editors, drawn from within the community.
