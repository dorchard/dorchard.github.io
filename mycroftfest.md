# Mycroftfest call for papers

We solicit contributions for a festschrift in honour of the work of Professor Alan Mycroft at the occassion of his retirement. Alan is known for his many pioneering contributions to programming language design and implementation, ranging from compilation and optimization techniques and type systems to parallel, concurrent and dataflow programming, but also for his work as a cofounder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. To those who worked with Alan, he is known for his unstoppable enthusiasm about any challenging problem related to programming and computers that make him an inspiring teacher, mentor and a collaborator.

To celebrate Alan's retirement, we solicit orginal contributions in all areas of programming language research, including clever hacker tricks, beautiful mathematical theories, practically useful programming techniques, novel language design ideas and visions for the future of education and programming technology. Just like Alan does not fit any pre-existing well-defined box, we invite contributions outside the established boxes that cover a wide range of areas and use a wide range of styles. The only criteria is academic interest and novelty and a connection to Alan's own work.

## Submission and evaluation

We intend to publish the festschrift as a special issue of the Springer LNCS series. The submissions should follow the LNCS formatting guidelines and should not typically exceed 25 pages. All submissions will be reviewed by at least two expert reviewers that will be appointed by the special issue editors.
