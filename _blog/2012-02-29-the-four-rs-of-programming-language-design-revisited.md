Following [my blog post last year](http://dorchard.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-four-rs-of-programming-language-design/ "my blog post last year") about the "four Rs of programming language design" I wrote a short essay expanding upon the idea which has now been included in the online post-proceedings of the ACM Onward '11 essay track (part of the [SPLASH conference](http://splashcon.org/2011/ "SPLASH conference")).

[The essay](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/onwards-essay-orchard11.pdf) was a lot of fun to write (I somehow end up referencing books from the 19th century, a sci-fi novel, 1984, and The Matrix!) and is a kind of mission statement (at least for myself) for language design; it is [available on my research page here](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/onwards-essay-orchard11.pdf "available on my research page here"). I hope that it provides some food-for-thought for others interested in, or working in, language design.
