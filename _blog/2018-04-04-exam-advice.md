Part of my job is to give advice to my undergraduate students about exam technique and preparing for exams. I was always quite nervous about exams "back in the day", and I put a lot of effort into revising and planning. In retrospect, I think I enjoyed these times: I have many happy memories of long days and evenings studying with my friends (whose presence and encouragement made it a lot more palatable). This year, I decided to serialise my advice and put it online in case it can be of any help or inspiration to others either taking exams, or giving exam advice. I'm sure I can think of more advice, so I made it a GitHub "gist" so I can revise it whenever more advice pops into my head. https://gist.github.com/dorchard/f7b9b95fe93c118fd1880197bcdfe196
