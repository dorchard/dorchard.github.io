Blogging... who has time for it? Well, I probably almost don't, but at the same time I often feel myself
itching to post a few things, e.g., ideas, announcements, little tidbits. And my old blog is a bit old
and crusty, hosted over at Wordpress, which is acting as a barrier to me just getting new, short posts out.
So I'm trying to setup a new system via the Jekyll static HTML setup I have here. Let's see how it goes.

I think I was able to import all my old Wordpress based posts at least, apart from the comments.
