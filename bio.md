# With history

Dominic is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Kent and Co-director of the Institute of Computing for Climate Science at the University of Cambridge. He studied Computer Science at the University of Warwick from 2004-2008 (MEng), followed by a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. He then worked as a Research Associate at both Imperial College London and Cambridge before joining Kent in 2016. In 2022 he re-joined Cambridge on a part-time basis to co-direct the Institute of Computing for Climate Science. His research centres on programming language theory and applications. His work includes the verification of computational science models and the interaction between semantics and logic to create the next-generation of programming languages.
